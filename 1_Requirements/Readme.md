## Research
Sudoku has been a popular puzzle game among kids, youngsters, older people. They are in newspapers, magazines, mobile games. The uniqueness of this game makes it so challenging and fun. I have been a fan of this game as a child, even now I like to play Sudoku once in a while and also tell other people about it.
## Benefits
### Improves concentration
It is impossible to solve a Sudoku puzzle without concentration. Since this game requires logical thinking, an interruption can break the chain of thought and force the player to restart their analysis. 
### Helps to reduce anxiety and stress
The two big bad words of todayâ€™s society can be tamed by a simple numbers puzzle. One of the benefits of Sudoku is that it requires the player to concentrate on the grid and use logical thinking to find the solution for each cell. While doing this, the brain becomes fully focus on the task at hand rather than the source of stress and anxiety.
### Promotes a healthy mindset
Sudoku is a puzzle with simple, easy to understand rules that any kid can try. The need to engage in logical thinking to fill the grid correctly plus the process of trial and error they must apply will naturally and unconsciously help to develop their problem-solving skills.

Furthermore, the challenge of solving what to a kid will seem like an easy and boring game also helps them to engage more intensely to finish it quickly and improves their concentration skills.
